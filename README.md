This script automates the process of lab management to give a formatted, detailed cost summary each month.

This script reads the lab schedule from my local PC filepath into a dataframe, it compares the schedule to the table of rates and restrictions.
Peak time and non-peak time are separated and summed, overage time is assessed and equipment rates are assessed as a ratio of actual usage.
(I wrote this script for fun to make lab and incubation management less tedious.)
